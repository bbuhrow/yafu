/*
We are given an array of bytes that has been sieved.  The basic trial
division strategy is as follows:

1) Scan through the array and 'mark' locations that meet criteria
indicating they may factor completely over the factor base.

2) 'Filter' the marked locations by trial dividing by small primes
that we did not sieve.  These primes are all less than 256.  If after
removing small primes the location does not meet another set of criteria,
remove it from the 'marked' list (do not subject it to further trial
division).

3) Divide out primes from the factor base between 256 and 2^13 or 2^14,
depending on the version (2^13 for 32k version, 2^14 for 64k).

4) Resieve primes between 2^{13|14} and 2^16, max.

5) Primes larger than 2^16 will have been bucket sieved.  Remove these
by scanning the buckets for sieve hits equal to the current block location.

6) If applicable/appropriate, factor a remaining composite with squfof

        // the primes (and therefore how many times it could have possibly landed
        // in the sieve block).  The most straightforward, and the method the SIMD
        // assembly uses, is to see if the roots (adjusted for the "real" progression)
        // minus the block location in question, divided by the prime, is zero.  if

        // arithmetic progression, repeatedly subtract each prime, and test after
        // each subtraction if we've hit the sieve location in question.  if so,
        // we know this location is on the prime's arithmetic progression and can 
        // proceed to trial divide.  For "large enough" primes, this is very efficient

        // division.  Since we are not really doing division tests, and instead are
        // doing multiplication by inverses, and futhermore since we might be doing those
        // multiplications 8 at a time using SIMD, resieving is only a win for the 
        // very largest primes less than 16 bits in size.  
        //
