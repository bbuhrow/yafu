	   graph is composed of a bunch of connected components, 
	   and each component contains one or more cycles. To 
	   find the cycles, you build the 'spanning tree' for 
	   each component.

	   Think of the spanning tree as a binary tree; there are
	   no cycles in it because leaves are only connected to a
	   common root and not to each other. Any time you connect 
	   together two leaves of the tree, though, a cycle is formed.
	   So, for a spanning tree like this:

	         1
	         o
		/ \
	    2  o   o  3
	      / \   \
	     o   o   o
	     4   5   6

	   if you connect leaves 4 and 5 you get a cycle (4-2-5). If
	   you connect leaves 4 and 6 you get another cycle (4-2-1-3-6)
	   that will reuse two of the nodes in the first cycle. It's
	   this reuse that makes double large primes so powerful.

	   For our purposes, every edge in the tree above represents
	   a partial relation. Every edge that would create a cycle
	   comes from another partial relation. So to find all the cycles,
	   you begin with the roots of all of the connected components,
	   and then iterate through the list of partial relations until 
	   all have been 'processed'. A partial relation is considered 
	   processed when one or both of its primes is in the tree. If 
	   one prime is present then the relation gets added to the tree; 
	   if both primes are present then the relation creates one cycle 
	   but is *not* added to the tree. 
	   
	   It's really great to see such simple ideas do something so
	   complicated as finding cycles (and doing it very quickly) */
