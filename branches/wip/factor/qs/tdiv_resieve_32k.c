/*
We are given an array of bytes that has been sieved.  The basic trial 
division strategy is as follows:

1) Scan through the array and 'mark' locations that meet criteria 
indicating they may factor completely over the factor base.  

2) 'Filter' the marked locations by trial dividing by small primes
that we did not sieve.  These primes are all less than 256.  If after
removing small primes the location does not meet another set of criteria,
remove it from the 'marked' list (do not subject it to further trial
division).

3) Divide out primes from the factor base between 256 and 2^13 or 2^14, 
depending on the version (2^13 for 32k version, 2^14 for 64k).  

4) Resieve primes between 2^{13|14} and 2^16, max.  

5) Primes larger than 2^16 will have been bucket sieved.  Remove these
by scanning the buckets for sieve hits equal to the current block location.

6) If applicable/appropriate, factor a remaining composite with squfof
